- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mikeobez
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in home automation, including philips hue integration, custom ESP wifi-enabled hardware and software development, and more. 
Sometimes, the goal isn't to save money, but rather the journey of learning that I can create instead.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning github, since I am new to it. 
- ğŸ“« Reach me at my email michael.oberhausen@yahoo.com
